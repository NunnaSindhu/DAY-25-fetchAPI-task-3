            Chuck Norris facts are satirical factoids about martial artist and actor
            Chuck Norris that have become an Internet phenomenon and as a result
            have become widespread in popular culture. The 'facts' are normally
            absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris' toughness, attitude, virility,
            sophistication, and masculinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chuck Norris facts have spread around the world, leading not only to
            translated versions, but also spawning localized versions mentioning
            country-specific advertisements and other Internet phenomena. Allusions
            are also sometimes made to his use of roundhouse kicks to perform
            seemingly any task, his large amount of body hair with specific regard
            to his beard, and his role in the action television series Walker, Texas
            Ranger.
